### Assignment I
- What is the path for your user's home directory? How do you change your current working directory to your user's home directory?
- How can you find out your current working directory?
- Create the following directory structure in your home user’s directory. Files can be empty or contain random text.
    - ~/h1
    - ~/h1/dir1
    - ~/h1/dir2
    - ~/h1/dir2/file1.txt
    - ~/h1/dir2/file2.txt
    - ~/h1/dir2/file3.txt
    - ~/h1/dir3
- Redirect your current user’s env (using printenv/env) to ~/h1/dir2/file1.txt
- From your user’s home directory(~), copy file1.txt into dir2 using relative path in a single command. 
- Create tmp directory inside your user's home directory. Copy dir2 and all its content into the tmp command. 
- Rename file1.txt in the dir2 directory to ‘copy_env.txt’ (file1.txt → copy_env.txt)
- Create a new file, perms.txt, and a new directory, admin, in your user's home directory. What are the permissions for the newly created file and directory?
- Change file (perms.txt) permissions using numerical format in the following way: owner → all permissions, group → read and write permissions, and other → no permissions. Return original permissions for the file using symbolic format.
- Change the permissions for the directory ‘admin' so that only the owner has read and execute access.
